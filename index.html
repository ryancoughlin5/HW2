		<p>
		My name is Ryan Coughlin. I am senior Business Analytics and Information Systems major from Davenport, Iowa.
		When I graduate in May (hopefully), I plan on moving to a big city, either Chicago or out of the midwest completely.
		In my free time I enjoy working out, hanging with my friends and family, and I enjoy learning and mastering new programming languages. Along with R and HTML/CSS that I am learning in class this semester, I am currently continuing to learn Python during my free time outside of class.

		The picture to the left is of my family when we took a vacation to Colorado in the summer of 2015. In this picture we are in the University of Colorado Boulder's football stadium. This is one of my favorite pictures because the mountains in the background almost look like they are photoshopped. From left to right is My sister, Sarah, my dad, Mike, my mom, Claire, me, and my other sister, Grace. Sarah and Grace are twins.
